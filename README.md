A smart contract to schedule transactions in the future. What if you want to schedule a transaction to be sent in a month or a year? With Crypto Clock, this is now possible! This allows for many new use cases in the crypto space... for example: - being able to schedule payments for a service long into the future (if you want your website to keep running long after you pass away) or - do all your payments on a single day and know that they will get executed on the scheduled date
